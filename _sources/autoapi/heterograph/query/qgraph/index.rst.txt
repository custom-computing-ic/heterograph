.. py:class:: HGraph(*, ginit=None, vinit=None, einit=None)

   Provides a high-level interface to analyse and manipulate arbitrary graph data structures.

   :class:`HGraph` encapsulates complex functionalities of the `graph-tool` library, and adds additional features like property maps for vertices and edges to capture arbitrary data and styling options.  Unlike `graph-tool`, vertices and edges maintain their original references when the graph is manipulated.

   Here are some key benefits:

   - **Property Mapping**: Each vertex and edge in the graph can have a custom property map associated with it. This allows you to associate arbitrary data with each element of your graph.

   - **Read-Only Mode**: You can set the graph into read-only mode, which will make any modifications fail with an error, preventing accidental changes.

   - **Styling Support**: The class provides support for styling both at a high level and individual elements. It uses Graphviz's Digraph module to generate SVG files of the graph, and it also supports viewing graphs directly on a webpage with interactive features such as zooming and panning.

   - **Subgraph Operations**: The class provides methods for adding/removing vertices and edges from the graph, which includes checking if a vertex or edge is valid before performing operations. It also supports copying of subgraphs, removal of subgraphs, and other operations.

   - **DFS Support**: It uses the DFS algorithm to find connected components, which can be useful for various tasks like graph partitioning.

   - **Rendering and Viewing**: The class provides methods for rendering the graph into different formats (like SVG) and viewing it directly on a webpage through a built-in HTTP server with interactive features.



   .. py:method:: __init__(*, ginit=None, vinit=None, einit=None)

      Initializes an instance of HGraph.

      This function sets up the initial state of the graph. It also allows optional initialization functions for graph, vertices, and edges to intialize the corresponding attributes in property maps. Note that a graph is initialized as **not** read-only.

      This function removes a specified vertex (or multiple vertices) along with all the edges that are incident
      on it in both directions i.e., incoming and outgoing edges. It also updates the internal dictionaries tracking
      neighbours of each vertex, so these changes will reflect in the `in_vx` and `out_vx` methods when called for
      this same vertices.

      :param vs: The ID(s) of the vertex to be removed. If it's a single integer, then it represents one
                 vertex. If it's a list, then it contains multiple vertices.
      :type vs: int or list
      :param verify: If True, raises an exception if any specified
                     vertex does not exist in the graph. Otherwise, any vertex not found is
                     ignored. Default is True.

      :type: (QueryTransformer)


.. py:class:: QueryTransformer(visit_tokens: bool = True)

   Bases: :py:obj:`lark.Transformer`


   A class used to transform parsed queries using the LARK grammar defined in :class:`QueryAQL<heterograph.query.aql.QueryAQL>`  into a more usable format.

   This class extends the lark.Transformer class and overrides its methods to provide custom transformations for different types of parsed query components. It basically transforms a string query into a QueryGraphDef object. The format of a QueryGraphDef object is as follows:
       * src (set): The set of source vertices.
       * snk (set): The set of sink vertices.
       * steps (list): The list of steps in the query graph.

   Each step helps construct the QGraph, and is represented by:
      * A vertex (2-tuple): `(vertex_id, vertex_args)`
      * An edge (3-tuple): `(vertex_id_src, vertex_id_tgt, edge_args)`

   Vertex and edge arguments are represented as a tuple containing a list of positional arguments and a dictionary of keyword arguments.

      :param n: The number of vertices to add. Default is 1.
      :type n: int

      :returns:

                * if `n` == 1: returns the ID (int) of newly added vertex
                * if `n` > 1`: returns a list of IDs (list of int) of the newly added vertices.
      :rtype: int or list

      .. rubric:: Example

      >>> g = HGraph()
      >>> g.add_vx()  # adds one new vertex
      0
      >>> g.add_vx(3)  # adds three new vertices

      >>> g.num_vx
      4



   .. py:method:: rm_vx(vs, verify=True)

      Remove one or more vertices from the graph and disconnect all edges connected to them.

      This function removes a specified vertex (or multiple vertices) along with all the edges that are incident
      on it in both directions i.e., incoming and outgoing edges. It also updates the internal dictionaries tracking
      neighbours of each vertex, so these changes will reflect in the `in_vx` and `out_vx` methods when called for
      this same vertices.

      :param vs: The ID(s) of the vertex to be removed. If it's a single integer, then it represents one
                 vertex. If it's a list, then it contains multiple vertices.
      :type vs: int or list
      :param verify: If True, raises an exception if any specified
                     vertex does not exist in the graph. Otherwise, any vertex not found is
                     ignored. Default is True.
      :type verify: bool, optional

      :raises RuntimeError: If any of the provided vertex IDs `vs` do not exist in the graph.

      .. rubric:: Example

      >>> g = HGraph()
      >>> g.add_vx(3)  # adds three vertices
      [0, 1, 2]
      >>> g.rm_vx(1)
      >>> g.vertices
      [0, 2]
      >>> g.rm_vx([0, 2])
      >>> g.vertices
      []



   .. py:method:: check_vx(vs, verify=False)

      Checks if a vertex (or set of vertices) exist in the graph.

      This function checks whether one or more vertices specified by their IDs exist in the graph or not. It returns True if all vertices are present and False otherwise. If `verify` is set to True, it raises an exception with an error message specifying which vertex does not exist (if any).

      :param vs: The ID(s) of the vertex/vertices to be checked. Can be a single integer or a list of integers.
      :type vs: int or list of ints
      :param verify: If True, raises an exception if any specified vertex does not exist in the graph. Default is False.
      :type verify: bool, optional

      :returns: True if all vertices are present and False otherwise.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises RuntimeError: If `verify` is set to True and any of the provided vertices do not exist in the graph. The error message contains the ID of that vertex that does not exist.

      .. rubric:: Example

      >>> g = HGraph()
      >>> vs = g.add_vx(3) # adds vertices [0, 1, 2]
      >>> g.check_vx([0, 2])
      True
      >>> g.check_vx(4)
      False



   .. py:property:: num_edges

      Returns the total number of edges present in the graph.


   .. py:property:: edges

      Returns a list of all edges as tuples (v1, v2) where each tuple represents an edge
      connecting vertex v1 and v2 in the graph instance. The vertices are identified by their integer IDs.


   .. py:method:: add_edge(s, t)

      Adds a new edge to the graph connecting two vertices `s` and `t`.

      Adds one or more edges between vertices. Notes:
         * adding a self-loop where vertex `s` == vertex `t` is ignored. Use vertex property maps.
         * adding multiple edges between any two vertices is ignored. Use edge property maps.

      :param s: The source vertex ID(s). If 's' is an integer, it represents one
                source vertex. If 's' is a list, it contains multiple source vertices.
      :type s: int or list of ints
      :param t: The target vertex ID(s). Similar to 's', if 't' is an integer it
                represents one target vertex and if 't' is a list, it contains multiple
                target vertices.
      :type t: int or list of ints

      :returns:

                A list of edges added as tuples in the format (source_vertex, target_vertex).
                            Each tuple represents an edge connecting source_vertex to target_vertex in the graph instance.

      :rtype: HGraph instance

      .. rubric:: Example

      >>> g = HGraph()
      >>> vs = g.add_vx(3)   # adds three vertices, returns their IDs [0, 1, 2]
