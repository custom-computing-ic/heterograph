Module Contents

.. py:class:: QueryResultSet(g, qgraph, results: list)

   Represents a result set of a query execution.

   :param g: The graph on which the query was executed.
   :type g: Graph
   :param qgraph: The query graph used for the execution.
   :type qgraph: QueryGraph
   :param results: The list of matches in the result set.
   :type results: list


   .. py:method:: __init__(g, qgraph, results: list)

      Initializes the instance with a graph, a query graph, and a list of results.

      The results can be in two formats:
         - A list of matches, where each match is a dictionary mapping identifiers to vertices: {'id0': vx0, 'id1': vx1... }
         - A list of matches, where each match is a list of vertices: [vx0, vx1, ...]

      :param g: The graph object.
      :param qgraph: The query graph.
      :param results: The list of results. Each result can be a dictionary mapping identifiers to vertices, or a list of vertices.
      :type results: list

      :raises RuntimeError: If an identifier from the query graph is not found in a match from the results.



   .. py:attribute:: ids

      the list of IDs in the query graph.


   .. py:attribute:: matches
      :value: None


      the list of matches in the result set.


   .. py:attribute:: qgraph

      The query graph used for the execution.


   .. py:attribute:: g

      the graph on which the query was executed.


   .. py:attribute:: vs

      set of vertices in the graph.


   .. py:attribute:: __iter
      :value: None


      iterator object for the result set.


   .. py:method:: apply(action, **kwargs)

      Applies the given action to the result set.

      :param action: The action to apply to the result set.
      :param kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass to the action.

      :returns: The result of applying the action to the result set.



   .. py:method:: _create_match_obj(ids, match)

      Creates a match object that represents a query result.

      :param ids: A list of IDs corresponding to the query result.
      :type ids: list
      :param match: A list of matches for the query result.
      :type match: list

      :returns: An instance of the Result class representing the query result.
      :rtype: Result

      :raises RuntimeError: If a vertex in the query result has been removed.



   .. py:method:: __repr__()


   .. py:property:: removed

      Returns the set of vertices that have been removed from the result set.

      :returns: The set of vertices that have been removed.
      :rtype: set


   .. py:property:: inserted

      Returns the set of vertices that were inserted into the graph since the creation of this result set.

      :returns: The set of inserted vertices.
      :rtype: set


   .. py:method:: __iter__()

      Returns an iterator object for the result set.



   .. py:method:: __next__()

      Retrieves the next match from the result set.

      :returns: A match object created using the ids and match data.

      :raises StopIteration: If there are no more matches in the result set.



   .. py:method:: __len__()

      Returns the number of matches in the result set.

      :returns: The number of matches in the result set.
      :rtype: int



   .. py:method:: __getitem__(item)

      Get the item at the specified index.

      :param item: The index of the item to retrieve.
      :type item: int

      :returns: The item at the specified index.
      :rtype: object
